# Image To ASCII
Outputs an image to a `o.txt` and/or to terminal drawn with ASCII symbols using python and pillow

To run the program just put a `i.jpg` in the same folder as the `main.py`

After running the program you can copy ASCII repesentation of your image from the output file or terminal

# Options
You can change some values (i.e. `compression` so you can make your ASCII art really small) in `main.py` to change the output
